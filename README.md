    <p>Your words breathe here.</p>

    <p style="color:#FFD6D6;">In English, we say, I can't stop thinking about you.
   
    In poetry, we say, I know we've only just met,and I don't mean to move too fast,</p>
    
<p style="color:#FFEAA7 ;"> but I couldn't sleep last night because I don't know your middle name
or how you take you for coffee.

  
And for some reason, there is nothing in the world that I would like to know more.</p>    

<p  style="color:#2ECC71 ;"> Except maybe how your hair looks when it's messy in the morning.
Or what makes you laugh until you cry.
Or what makes you laugh when you're crying.
  
Either, or both. Or. All of those facts would be fine.</p>

<p style="color: #A29BFE;" > And I know we only just met,
and I don't mean to move too fast,
but I couldn't focus this morning </p>



<p style="color:#FFD6D6 ;" > because I need to know your preference in take out food.
And the dreams you'd never say out loud, but secretly wish to come true.
And if I were to buy you flowers,
would you want them to be blue?</p>

<p style="color#DFF9FB: ;" > And I know we only just met,
and I don't mean to move too fast, </p>

<p style="color: #ECF0F1;" >but suddenly your voice is in my head, playing on repeat.
And I'll probably never say any of this,
and I should probably get some sleep.</p>
<p style="color:#FFBE76 ;"  >It's just that suddenly everything that's significant to you is significant to me."</p>
